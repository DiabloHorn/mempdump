Process Memory Dumper

This is just a little utilitie ment to dump the memory of a running process.
It doesn't have to much options we did that on purpose so that peeps adjust the code themselves.
The program is able to:

List the current running processes.
Show additional info on them
dump the memory of the process ever 24000Bytes.

The dump will be in ascii (%c) if you want it in hex or something else just adjust the code.

Hope you find this usefull

Greetz,
